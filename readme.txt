=== Edit Any Table ===Contributors: redeyedmonsterDonate link: Tags: database, table, update, insert, add, delete, edit, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, data, editor, widget, dashboardRequires at least: 3.0.0Tested up to: 4.0Stable tag: trunkLicense: GPLv2 or laterLicense URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.htmlA WordPress plugin/Dashboard Widget that allows you to connect to any database and edit the contents.== Description ==This plugin can be integrated as a dashboard widget or use its own admin page to allow you to connect to any MySQL database of your choice (as long as your hosting allows) and search, edit, add and delete records in an easy to use interface.  Ideal if you have built a site referencing another database and you want to allow other editors/administators of the site to alter, update, delete, add and correct entries.== Installation ==* To install, download the .zip file, extract the contents and place the edit-any-table folder in your plugin directory (typically \\your-site\wp-content\plugins\)* Once installed go to the Dashboard->Plugins page of your WordPress site and activate the plugin.* Now go to the Dashboard->Settings->Edit Any Table page and enter the required details. * First you will need to enter the host (often localhost), the name of the database you wish to connect to and a valid user name and password. * Under Admin Settings you can choose to allow Administrators only to have access to the widget or Editors as well. Note: If neither of these boxes are ticked the widget will not display in your WordPress Dashboard. * Display Settings allows you to select the maximum number of columns to display for returned searches. Edit Any Table displays best in a single column dashboard configuration and I find five columns is a comfortable fit but adjust to suit.* Also here you can set a friendly name for the database you are connecting to (less confusing for your users)For full details and user guide visit [RedEyedMonster Edit-Any-Table](http://redeyedmonster.co.uk/edit-any-table/)== Frequently Asked Questions === If I save a text field with an apostrophe (') a backslash (\) is inserted prior to it in the database =WordPress assumes, for backwards capability, that Magic Quotes is switched on. Magic Quotes is used in earlier versions of PHP to prevent SQL injection.  If you are outputting the data from the database yourself into a post then use the function stripslashes_deep() i.e. `$records = stripslashes_deep($wpdb->get_results($sql,'ARRAY_A'));`. See the [codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/stripslashes_deep).= Help! I've upgraded to version 2 and I can't see anything =Version 2 is a significant update with a number of new settings. Check all the settings and ensure you have selected a display mode and the tables to display.= Can Edit any Table be translated into my language? =Yes! Instructions can be found via the settings page.= Why can't I see the widget in the dashboard? =Probably because you have not selected 'Editor' or 'Administrator' in the settings. Go to Settings->Edit Any Table and correct this.= There are no tables in the drop down list, why? =You have entered invalid database information. Check the settings.== Screenshots ==1.
